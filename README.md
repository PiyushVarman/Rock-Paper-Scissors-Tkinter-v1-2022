# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Tkinter-v1-2022
Made with Python and Tkinter, by @Rahul-LJ and yours truly!

Download all of the files here and run the Python File, works out-of-the-box!

Work Done:
Rahul LJ (@Rahul-LJ) :
Worked on the title screen, end screen and overall formatting

Piyush Varman (@PiyushVarman) :
Worked on the rules, game window and the scorekeeping parts of the program, including formatting changes

(The pair of us are noobs in this branch of Python Programming, hence, suggestions are appreciated!)
